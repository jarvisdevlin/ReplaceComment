# ReplaceComment

ReplaceComment is a mod for Geometry Dash that allows you to replace specific text in comments with your own replacements. Now you can control the comment section! (like the government)

## Usage

1. Create a file which will contain the replacement rules in the format `word ==> replacement`.
2. Open mod settings and drop the file in.
3. Restart the game and go to any comment section and look at the horrible thing you just did.

## Example

```
egg ==> duck
google.tk ==> google.com
obama ==> obamna
```
